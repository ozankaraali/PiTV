# PiTV - STB Client

A cross-platform STB player client.

## Installation

You could download the software from [RELEASES](https://github.com/ozankaraali/PiTV/releases).

Alternatively, you could do:

```
git clone https://github.com/ozankaraali/PiTV/
cd PiTV && yarn && yarn make
```

## Usage

You need to enter your IPTV provider's details to Settings. When you save, if your authentication works, you will directly see the channel lists on the left side. Select a channel and it will begin shorty.
